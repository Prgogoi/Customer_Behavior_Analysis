# Customer_Behavior_Analysis

📊 Data Analytics End-to-End Project

📌 Overview

This project showcases a complete data analytics workflow, from loading and exploring raw data in Python to cleaning it, performing SQL analysis, creating an interactive Power BI dashboard, and delivering a final report and presentation.
The goal is to uncover meaningful insights, support data-driven decisions, and demonstrate end-to-end analytical capability.

📁 Dataset

Source: Kaggle.com

Format: CSV / Excel / Database table

Description: Dataset contains information on (briefly describe domain—sales, customers, operations, etc.).

Key Fields: (List major columns and what they represent)

🛠 Tools & Technologies

🧭 Steps Followed in the Project

1️⃣ Data Loading (Python)

Imported the dataset using Pandas.

Checked data structure, types, and initial summary.


2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized data distribution, trends, and patterns.

Detected outliers, correlations, and feature relationships.


3️⃣ Data Cleaning

Handled missing values and duplicates.

Corrected inconsistent formatting and standardized column names.

Engineered additional features when necessary.

Exported the cleaned dataset for SQL and BI use.


4️⃣ SQL Analysis

Loaded cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server.

Wrote queries to:

Aggregate KPIs

Join and filter tables

Identify trends and anomalies

Validated Python findings with SQL results.


5️⃣ Dashboard Creation (Power BI)

Connected Power BI to cleaned data/SQL database.

Built interactive visuals including:

📈 Trend charts

📊 KPI cards

🗂 Category breakdowns

🎛 Slicers for filtering

Focused on clarity and business storytelling.


6️⃣ Reporting & Presentation

Compiled insights into a clean, easy-to-read report.

Created a professional PowerPoint summarizing findings and recommendations.


📉 Dashboard
